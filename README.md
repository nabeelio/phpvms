## Development Environment with Docker

A full development environment can be brought up using Docker, without having to install composer/npm locally

```bash
make docker-test

# **OR** with docker-compose directly

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Then go to `http://localhost`. If you're using dnsmasq, the `app` container is listening on `phpvms.test`, or you can add to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1   phpvms.test
```

The `docker-compose.local.yml` overrides the `app` section in `docker-compose.yml`. The standard `docker-compose.yml` can be used if you want to deploy from the image, or as a template for your own Dockerized deployments.

### Building JS/CSS assets

Yarn is required, run:

```bash
make build-assets
```

This will build all of the assets according to the webpack file.
